# WolfMedia Database Management System (DBMS)


## Overview

This project involves designing and building a robust Database Management System (DBMS) for WolfMedia, a cutting-edge streaming service similar to Spotify and Apple Music. The DBMS will serve as a central platform for administrators and management to efficiently maintain information on songs, artists, record labels, albums, podcasts, and podcast hosts. Additionally, the system will handle essential tasks such as tracking monthly listeners, total subscribers, and making payments to artists, record labels, and podcast hosts.

## Key Features

### Information Processing: 
The DBMS enables seamless entry, updating, and deletion of basic information about songs, artists, podcast hosts, and podcast episodes, ensuring accurate and up-to-date data.
### Metadata Maintenance: 
Advanced features allow for real-time updates of play counts for songs, monthly listeners for artists, subscriber count, and ratings for podcasts, and listening counts for podcast episodes.
### Payment Tracking: 
The system automates royalty payments for songs and ensures streamlined payments to podcast hosts, simplifying financial management for WolfMedia.
### Insightful Reports: 
Dynamic reporting capabilities generate comprehensive monthly play counts, revenue figures, and payment details for artists, record labels, and podcast hosts. Additionally, the system provides a detailed list of songs and podcast episodes associated with specific artists, albums, and podcasts.

## Technologies Used

### Java: 
The primary programming language for the development of the DBMS.
### JDBC: 
Facilitates seamless interaction between Java applications and the database management system.
### MariaDB/MySQL: 
The chosen database management system to store and manage the vast amount of data associated with WolfMedia.
